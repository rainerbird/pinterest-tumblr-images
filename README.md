# Tumblr + HTML5 Boilerplate #

Tumblrplate is a naked Tumblr theme built using HTML5 Boilerplate (http://html5boilerplate.com/)

All assets are already uploaded and hosted on Tumblr's static server (e.g normalize.css, Modernizr, jQuery).

Includes all post types, {RSS}, {Favicon}, {CustomCSS}, {LinkOpenTag} (for Photo posts), {MetaDescription}, and {PhotoAlt}.

To begin using, you may want to host your CSS and Javascript files on your own public host (like FTP or even Dropbox).

This is intended to be just a base to begin creating a theme from, hence why there is are no styles applied. See the demo here: http://boilerplatetheme.tumblr.com/

## Common Problems ##
- As Google Analytics is a part of HTML5 Boilerplate, this has been included in the theme. **But will only be included if a Google Analytics Web Property ID is given as a meta tag.**
